<p align="center">The ThriveWell application provides the tools needed to track daily changes in chronic health conditions and to establish patterns for those symptoms. Doctors and patients can use the daily journal and symptom logs to track symptoms and their severity every day as well as the potential environmental and physiological triggers for those symptoms.

Overtime, patients and care providers can see which triggers and most likely linked to symptom flair ups and tailor health management plans around those triggers.</p>
