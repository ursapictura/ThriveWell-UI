      <h1>The FODMAP Diet: An Overview</h1>
      <p>The FODMAP Diet is a dietary approach designed to help manage symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other functional gastrointestinal disorders. FODMAP is an acronym for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyolsâ€”types of short-chain carbohydrates that can be poorly absorbed in the gut, leading to symptoms such as bloating, gas, diarrhea, or constipation.</p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>The FODMAP Diet is implemented in three phases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Elimination Phase:</strong> High-FODMAP foods are completely avoided for 4 to 6 weeks to assess symptom improvement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reintroduction Phase:</strong> Foods are reintroduced one at a time to identify specific triggers and individual tolerance levels.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Personalization Phase:</strong> Based on the results of the reintroduction phase, a tailored diet is created that minimizes symptoms while allowing as many foods as possible.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who It&apos;s For</h2>
      <p>The FODMAP Diet is primarily intended for individuals with IBS or other gastrointestinal issues, such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). It may also benefit people with functional bloating or food sensitivities.</p>

      <h2>Foods Prohibited by the FODMAP Diet (High-FODMAP Foods)</h2>
      <p>During the elimination phase, the following categories of foods are avoided:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Fruits:</strong> High-fructose fruits such as apples, pears, cherries, watermelon, and mangoes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vegetables:</strong> High-FODMAP vegetables like onions, garlic, cauliflower, asparagus, and Brussels sprouts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legumes:</strong> Lentils, chickpeas, kidney beans, and black beans.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dairy:</strong> Products high in lactose, including milk, soft cheeses, yogurt, and cream.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Grains:</strong> Wheat, rye, and barley (especially in large amounts).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sweeteners:</strong> Polyol-containing sweeteners such as sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol, and xylitol.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Processed Foods:</strong> Many packaged and processed foods containing high-FODMAP ingredients like inulin or high-fructose corn syrup.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Foods Allowed on the FODMAP Diet (Low-FODMAP Foods)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Fruits:</strong> Bananas, oranges, strawberries, blueberries, and kiwis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vegetables:</strong> Spinach, zucchini, cucumbers, carrots, and bell peppers.
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>

          <strong>Nuts and Seeds:</strong> Almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, and pumpkin seeds (in small portions).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Benefits and Considerations</h2>
      <p>The FODMAP Diet has been shown to significantly reduce symptoms of IBS in many individuals and improve overall quality of life. However, the elimination phase can be restrictive and may require guidance from a dietitian to ensure nutritional balance and proper execution. It&apos;s important to gradually reintroduce foods to develop a sustainable, personalized approach.</p>
